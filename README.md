canvasTutorial
==============

canvasTutorial is small python based web server that runs a few pages that showcase the HTML5 canvas element.

It is also my first GitHub repo.

Main reason I did this is to learn more about Web, Python & Github development.

------------
For Linux, with git, python & pip installed

If you see nothing, there must be a problem.
